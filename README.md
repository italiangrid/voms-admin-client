# VOMS Admin client

The Virtual Organization Membership Service is a Grid attribute authority which
serves as central repository for VO user authorization information, providing
support for sorting users into group hierarchies, keeping track of their roles
and other attributes in order to issue trusted attribute certificates and
assertions used in the Grid environment for authorization purposes.

The voms-admin command line tool provides access to the most common VOMS Admin
service administrative operations.

For obtaining the list of supported commands, use:

voms-admin --list-commands

For getting help about a specific command, use:

voms-admin --help-command <command-name>
